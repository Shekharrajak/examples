Blinking an LED is the “Hello World” example of the microcontroller world. It’s a nice way to warm up and start your journey into the land of embedded hardware. For this example, you will need a Spark Core (duh!), a Breadboard, an LED, a Resistor (we will soon find out a suitable value) and an USB cable. Note, that if you don't have these things, the example will still work, and simply blink the on-board LED instead of the external one.
