About
=====

A repo for sharing, refining, and cultivating broadly useful Spark Core firmware examples.

This repo is used to populate the example application firmware in the [Spark Web IDE](https://www.spark.io/build).

Our goal for this repo is to provide a place where people can contribute awesome code and content to help others learn and to illustrate best practices for documentation, software architecture, and hardware design.

How to Use
----------

![browse, flash, and fork Spark Core firmware](http://s3.amazonaws.com/spark-website/forkable_firmware_screenshot.png)

How to Contribute
-----------------

1. Identify a learning gap that existing examples don't cover OR see something amazing on the [community site](community.spark.io).
1. Propose the example with GitHub issue tagged with "Proposed Example". Try to rally people to comment on what the example should do, what learning goals will it advance, etc. Feel free to write an example README to illustrate what you're thinking.
2. Fork the repo, add a sub-directory, spark.json, README.md, and code. 
You can use the [blink_led](/blink_led) for a solid simple example of what goes in a good example.
3. Issue a pull request.
