About
=====

A repo for sharing, refining, and cultivating broadly useful Spark Core firmware examples and corresponding code used to interact with the firmware.

Roadmap
-------

Step 1: Consolidate Spark's example firmware from [docs.spark.io](http://docs.spark.io) here and make them available within the Spark IDE using this repo as a backend.

Step 2: Find a way to pull cool things people do with the examples back into this repo.

Step 3: Figure out how to make this repo maximally awesome together!
Jump on IRC at #spark or rock the [forums](http://community.spark.io) and join the conversationl.
