About
=====

A repo for sharing, refining, and cultivating broadly useful Spark Core firmware examples and corresponding code used to control or read data from a Core. These examples are designed to exemplify what you can do with a Core and make it easier to get started.

How to Use
----------

The firmware examples in this repo are used to periodically populate flashable app examples in the [Spark Web IDE](https://www.spark.io/build) that user's can browse, flash, and fork Spark Core firmware.

Roadmap
-------

Right only 2 the (led_blink and rc_car) are loaded in the IDE, however, soon we'll be finishing the rest of these examples and adding more from the Spark [docs site](http://docs.spark.io/#/examples) and from other [awesome projects in the community](https://community.spark.io/category/project-share). Stay tuned.
