About
=====

A repo for sharing, refining, and cultivating broadly useful Spark Core firmware examples and corresponding code used to control or read data from a Core. The firmware examples in this repo are used to populate flashable app examples in the [Spark Web IDE](https://www.spark.io/build).

Roadmap
-------

Right now there are placeholders for several projects in here, and only 2 are actually loaded in the IDE (led_blink and rc_car).  Soon we'll be finishing these examples and adding more from the Spark [docs site](http://docs.spark.io/#/examples) and from [awesome easy to share projects in the community](https://community.spark.io/category/project-share). Stay tuned.
